# Map Editor

## Description

This is a project developed in <A/C>.
This is a simple map editor that allow us to paint cells on a grid.This was challenging at the time and building the grid using SimpleGraphics GFX
was one of the best times, because finally i could have some resulting visuals through my code and i just love that!
We can select the number of columns and rows once we instantiate the grid, and then we can select the position of the brush in the same way.

##Instructions

You can move the brush that is a green circle within the cells of the grid using the ARROW KEYS.
The brush paint each cell by pressing SPACE and you can clear the color of the cell by pressing SPACE.

##features
Simple grid painter using just the arrow keys and space. you can color multiple cells by pressing SPACE and move the brush with the ARROW KEYS.

##Visuals
I've included a package with the name of Visuals where you have screenshots on how this app works and the flow.

##ROADMAP
new features will be included in future like selecting different colors for your drawing and be able to save the drawing
and re-open same drawing.
